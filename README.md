## NyeverGator's TOP Rock Paper Scissors Project 

This directory is for me to store the Rock Paper Scissors project I made for The Odin Project curriculum.

Here are the steps on how to play it:

1. Clone this repository to your computer. 
2. Set up both HTML and JavaScript files to your code editor.
3. Run the HTML file to display webpage.
4. A prompt will pop-up on the webpage but before you enter something:
    * Make sure to open the **Developer Console** to see the results of your input.
    * *Ctrl + Shift + I* or *Ctrl + Shift + J* on **Windows** and **Linux**.
    * *Ctrl + Option + J* on **macOs**.
5. There you go, you can now play RoPaSc! 
    * Refresh webpage if you encounter any problems.
    * Also refresh webpage if the game is over.

## GUI for RoPaSc is coming!

As of writing, the game is only playable in the Developer Console (as well as through the prompt pop-up) but once I learn how to manipulate the DOM through JavaScript, it's possible that I will be revisiting this project and make a separate branch for the GUI.

Stay tuned!
